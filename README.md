## Number Guesses Doubles
Below is the result of the first paired project in Mod 1 1904 at Turing School of Software and Design. Number Guesser Doubles is a game for two players. A random number is generated between a default range of 1 to 100 and the players guesses are compared to the random number. The players also have the option to update the range. Error messages append to the DOM when the guesses are not within the range, either guess or name fields are empty or if the characters entered are not appropriate to the field. A winner card pops up on the right showing the winners name, the players and the number of guesses to get to the win. Play a game with a friend, and have fun!
